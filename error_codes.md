### Error codes

The API will return standard HTTP return codes in case of an error. In some cases there will be additional, human readable, information in the response body.

Common error cases: 

* Code 404 (Not Found) refers to the main resource, i.e. in most cases the Subscription.

* Code 407 (Conflict)

* Code 400 (Bad Request)
