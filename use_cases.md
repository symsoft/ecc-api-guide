## Use cases

Some of the more common use cases are described here. The information provided is informative only, for the exact specification see [API Specification](api_specification.md). 

Use cases are described with a sample command using _[curl](https://curl.haxx.se)_, together with the corresponding HTTP request and response.

There is also a more visual API explorer web page available on the API Gateway server. The address of this page is given as part of [onboarding](onboarding.md) process.
