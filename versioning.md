### Versioning

API version numbers follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). A version number consists of three numbers separated by dots, for example 1.2.3. The parts are MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where:

- MAJOR version is incremented at incompatible API changes.
- MINOR version is incremented when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
- PATCH version is incremented when making backwards-compatible bug fixes.

The base URL specifies what MAJOR version to use, i.e. /ecc/v1 is valid for version 1.n.n of the API.

We will do our best to

__Note that before the API reaches a version 1.0.0 release things will be changing and may not be following the rules above.__
