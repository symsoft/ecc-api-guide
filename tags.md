### Tags

Tags can be applied to subscriptions to make it easier to organise them, i.e. by purpose, owner, or environment.

* A tag has no semantic meaning in ECC
* Allowed characters in a tag are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, \_ and -.
* Tags are case sensitive, i.e. `tag` and `TAG` are two different tags
* Max length of a tag is 100 characters
* Up to 10 tags can be applied to a subscription

It is also possible to filter on tags when listing subscriptions.

Examples:

* `customer_2435`
* `country_se`
* `sensor-id_13456`
