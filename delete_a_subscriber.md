### Delete a Subscriber

Some text.

__TODO: Must decide and describe if a SIM is dead (deleted) after this operation. In a future version we may have multiple Subscription Types. It may be so that a change of Subscription Type only can be performed by means of a delete & create, and is such case the SIM is to be re-used. For a normal deletion the SIM should be void and not used ever again.__
