## About

__TODO: Don't call this chapter "About", figure out something better. Also break up in fragments.__

The ECC API is a REST (ref needed) API.

Formally described in Swagger format (see xxx).

Using HTTP over TLS with JSON payload.

The book describes version 0.3.0 of the API. 

### API versioning

Follows Semantic Versioning (ref needed). The base URL /ecc/v1 is valid for version 1.n.n of the API. 

__Note that before the API reaches a version 1.0.0 release things will be changing and may not be following the rules above.__

### Authentication

Basic Authentication, but also a Cookie based mechanism (describe /login and /logout URLs).

__TODO: Write a paragraph about cookies, load balancing and token expiry.__

### License

The API is covered by Apache 2.0 License.

This book is probably some kind of CC (need ref).
