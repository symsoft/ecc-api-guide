## API philosophy

The ECC API is a REST (ref needed) API.

Using HTTP over TLS with JSON payload.

POST operations are async (returns 202) and will eventually be executed.

The book describes version 0.4.0 of the API. 

Formally described in Swagger format (see chapter [API Specification](swagger_specification.md)).

The API is covered by [Apache 2.0 License](license.md).
