## Prerequisites

Before an ECC User is able to start using the API there are a few manual steps that must be completed.

__TODO: Break up in fragments.__

### Onboarding

Manual process currently not part of the API.

ECC User gets login credentials.

A default subscription type is set up, including basic HLR & OCS settings.

A number of Services are set up.

TODO: Probably need some example services here.

### SIM ordering

Manual process currently not part of the API.

The ECC User will get a set of SIM cards. Each card is identified by a ICCID number usually printed on the physical card.
