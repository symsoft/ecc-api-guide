### Onboarding

The onboarding process is a manual process currently not part of the API.

The SIM profile to be used by the API User is established. This profile is used later in the [SIM ordering](sim_ordering.md) process.

A Subscription type is set up, including basic HLR & OCS settings. This Subscription type is specific to the API User and is not available to other API Users. The Subscription type may also include one or several default Services.

A number of Services that may be used by the Subscriptions are set up (see [Example services](example_services.md)). Again, these services are specific to the API User and is not available to other API Users.

Billing arrangements are set up.

Finally the API User gets login credentials and address to an API Gateway server.
